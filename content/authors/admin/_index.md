The twentieth century saw two revolutions of our understanding of the natural world in the formulation and development of quantum theory and the theory of general relativity. Their predictions have been verified to a spectacular degree experimentally and are central to a number of technologies (have you ever used a computer or a GPS?).
Our best stories the natural world, the standard model of particle physics and the standard model of cosmology, are told in the languages of quantum theory and general relativity.
